My experience building production-ready apps — from a government-commissioned cultural platform to housing finance systems — taught me that real impact happens when <strong>robust architecture meets practical implementation</strong>.",
			"My background in MySQL, Express, React, and Node.js shapes how I approach AI: I understand data pipelines through database design, model serving through APIs, and scalability through distributed systems.",
			"Currently, I'm building ML models in Python and integrating them into full-stack applications — ensuring they are <strong>engineered to scale</strong>, not just operate in isolation."
